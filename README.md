# Early Disease Risk Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the risk of diabetes based on patient data. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Introduction

Early detection of diabetes is an important challenge in preventive healthcare, particularly when decisions must be made based on limited and structured clinical data. This project was undertaken to explore the effectiveness of classical machine learning methods for early disease risk prediction and to better understand their behavior in a medical context.

Using a publicly available diabetes dataset, I implemented and compared multiple supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The focus was placed not only on predictive accuracy but also on interpretability, robustness, and reproducibility of results—factors that are especially relevant in biomedical research.

The project follows a complete experimental pipeline, covering data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using standard performance metrics. By comparing multiple models under the same experimental setup, this work provides insight into the strengths and limitations of different approaches for structured healthcare data.

Through this project, I aimed to build a solid foundation in applied machine learning research and to develop skills relevant to interdisciplinary research environments
